### Tuts+ Course: Getting Started With TypeScript
#### Instructor: Jeremy McPeak

JavaScript is more than 15 years old and yet the tools we have to make JavaScript-based development still pale in comparison to the tools of other languagesâ€”primarily statically-typed languages. What if I told you that you could write a dialect of JavaScript, use new features found in ECMAScript 6, have great IDE support and run idiomatic JavaScript in the browser (or even server)? Sounds good, right? Then give TypeScript a look. Please note: an understanding of the JavaScript language is assumed in this course.
